** Execution
	Before compiling the samples you have to make sure the env for Zephyr is ok. Execute the following command:

 #+BEGIN_SRC bash
 source ${ZEPHYR_BASE}/zephyr-env.sh # just once. At 
 #+END_SRC

	For executing this sample, we have to execute this to the Native Posix board:

 #+BEGIN_SRC bash
 rm -rf build && west build -b native_posix
 #+END_SRC

	For calculating the memory footprint for this sample, we have to execute this to the nrf52840dongle board:
   
 #+BEGIN_SRC bash
 CONF_FILE=prj_nrf52840dongle_nrf52840.conf; rm -rf build && west build -b nrf52840dongle_nrf52840
 #+END_SRC
